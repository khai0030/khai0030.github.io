        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I was born in Lebanon on July 15<sup>th</sup> and lived there for 18 years. My sister moved to Canada when I was 10. I decided then that when I graduate high school, I’m going to follow her, and here I am today after 8 years. I have been working really hard for this day to come.</p>
        <p>I have many hobbies, and these include: dancing, photography, martial arts (more specifically <emp>Wing Chun</emp> Kung Fu), cooking, and playing instruments like guitar and piano although I’m self taught and do not really play well. My favorite hobby though, is gaming. I love spending time with my friends on Discord while we play together, and I would like to be a streamer one day.</p>
        <p>Here's a quote that i kept on my desk everytime i studied and got me here today:
    <blockquote>I can and I will. Watch me.<cite>-Carrie Green</cite></blockquote> </p>
